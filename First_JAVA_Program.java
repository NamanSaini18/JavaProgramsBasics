// This is my first Java Program code. This is the most basic program in which we are learning the syntax and other basics of java programming language.

public class Firstclass {                      // Here Firstclass is the name of the class
    public static void main(String args[]) {           // This is the basic syntax of writing a program in java programming
        System.out.println("HELLO WORLD");                // This statement is used for output in java programming
    }                                // In JAVA Programming, We have to end our statement with semicolon(;) unlike python otherwise our program will not execute.
}
// Our output will be --> HELLO WORLD

// This is our second basic program of java in which we have tried to print output in different lines. Syntax is same , only we have used three different output statements. We are just trying different things here.

public class Firstclass {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("HELLO WORLD");
        System.out.println("Hlo guys I am Naman Saini");
        System.out.println("Welcome to java programming");  // We can also use single quotes inside the parenthesis of output statement but as a convention we will use double quotes everywhere.
    }
}
 // Here O/P will be: 
//  HELLO WORLD
//  Hlo guys I am Naman Saini
//  Welcome to java programming
